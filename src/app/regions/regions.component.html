            Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. It shares
            the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia
            with both Europe and Africa. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30%
            of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home
            to the majority of the human population,[5] was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable
            for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely
            populated regions. Its 4.5 billion people constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.

            The Americas (also collectively called America) comprise the totality of the continents of North and South America. Together,
            they make up most of the land in Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the New World. Along with their associated
            islands, they cover 8% of Earth's total surface area and 28.4% of its land area. The topography is dominated
            by the American Cordillera, a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast. The flatter eastern
            side of the Americas is dominated by large river basins, such as the Amazon, St. Lawrence River / Great Lakes
            basin, Mississippi, and La Plata. Since the Americas extend 14,000 km (8,700 mi) from north to south, the climate
            and ecology vary widely, from the arctic tundra of Northern Canada, Greenland, and Alaska, to the tropical rain
            forests in Central America and South America. Humans first settled the Americas from Asia between 42,000 and
            17,000 years ago.

            Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is bordered by
            the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. It comprises
            the westernmost part of Eurasia. Since around 1850, Europe is most commonly considered as separated from Asia
            by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas and the
            waterways of the Turkish Straits. Though the term "continent" implies physical geography, the land border is
            somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into
            two continents reflects East-West cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences.

            Oceania are Bonin Islands, a politically integral part of Japan; Hawaii, a state of the United States; Clipperton
            Island, a possession of France; the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, belonging to Chile; the Campbell Islands, belonging
